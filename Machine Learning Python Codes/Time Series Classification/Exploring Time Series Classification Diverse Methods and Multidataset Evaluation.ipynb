Note that you can always link the network to a fully connected layer to match the output size. You can freely construct any structure you want. Report the average test scores of four models on three datasets you chose. It would be four scores in total. Mark the best model in terms of the average test score. Briefly explain the structure you constructed. There is no definitive answer, and it is up to your own model. Here it would be best if you keep the following rules:\n","\n","- When initially loading the dataset, use sktime's `load_UCR_UEA_dataset` function. This is for our grading purpose.\n","- You should use at least **two** Tensorflow callbacks when you fit your model. These can be built-in ones or your personalized callback.\n","- You should use Tensorflow's data API (`tf.data`) to manage your dataset and use `shuffle`, `batch,` and `prefetch` functions. This means that you need to convert the data format using the `from_tensor_slices` function. This also means that you need to create your own validation set. You are not limited to using any methods to do this, but you may also need to shuffle the dataset before (for that, you can use `np.random.permutation`).\n","- You need to clearly report the **test accuracy** of the four models. Training and validation accuracy scores are not enough.\n","- You may need to deal with datasets of different sizes.
